Project Version Control Documentation

GitHub Operations in This Project

We have successfully implemented Git version control best practices, including branch management, merging, and tagging. Below is a summary of all the steps we performed.

Branch Management

1Ô∏è Created Two Branches

We created two separate branches to work on different features independently without affecting the main branch:

Branch 1: feature-branch

Branch 2: feature-branch-2

This allowed us to implement changes in isolation before merging them into the main branch.

Adding Files & Making Changes

In each branch, we made necessary modifications to the project. This included:

Creating a new file named newFile.txt

Updating the README.md file with documentation

These changes were committed and pushed to GitHub to ensure proper version tracking.

Merging Changes into main Branch

Once all changes were completed and verified, we merged both branches into the main branch. This ensured that all updates were successfully integrated into the project without disrupting the workflow.

Deleting Feature Branches

After successfully merging, we deleted both feature-branch and feature-branch-2 to keep the repository clean and organized. Removing unnecessary branches helped in maintaining a structured workflow.

Milestone Tagging (Version 1.0 Release)

To signify a stable release, we created a milestone labeled v1.0. This marked the completion of this phase of the project and helped in tracking stable versions.

Removing the Milestone

Later, based on new requirements, we removed the milestone v1.0 both locally and remotely. This ensured that the project remained flexible for future updates and improvements.

Finalizing the Project

Confirmed that all changes were successfully merged into the main branch.

Deleted unnecessary feature branches to keep the repository clean.

Updated the README.md file to document the version control workflow.
